# Data-Analysis-Problem
This repository contains the code for a data analysis problem. As a solution, a excel sheet was written using Python code. In this problem, I had to calculate the numbers of orders in which courier company overcharged, undercharged or charged correctly on a particular order of company X. Two excel sheets were created: order summary and order_info. 

Order summary: It contains summary of the total number of orders overcharged, undercharged or charged correctly.

Order info: It contains order level calculations.
